# HistoryLover🛡️

A simple tool to extract the history from browsers to exfiltrate them using Discord. Built for **security research** and **educational purposes only**, not for shady stuff.
You can grab it and integrate it into your own projects.

## Why Discord❓

Honestly? Because it’s kinda cool. Plus, Discord is rarely blocked in corporate environments... not that you should use it there! (Seriously, **don’t do anything dumb.**)

## How does it work?⚙️

- Extracts the history from History files located in the AppData directory of every browser.

- Compresses the file to prepare it for exfiltration.

- Sends to a Discord server using a webhook.
